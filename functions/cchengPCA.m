function [PCs]=cchengPCA(HIM,M)
%% Code Comments:
%PCA does what PCA does best
%Should consider to sue the built-in MATLAB PCA version
%
% There are two parameters,cchengPCA(HIM,M) where the HIM is the
% Hyperspectral image cube, which is a 3-D data matrix
% [XX,YY,bnd] = size(HIM), XX YY are the image size,
% bnd is the band number of the image cube.
% M appears to be the number of components or what not ...

%% Authors Comments
%	Algorithm name: principal components analysis (PCA)
%	Category: component analysis-based transform
%	Designed criteria: eigenvalues
%	Designed method: sample covariance matrix
%	Typical use (LOI?s addressed): data representation by eigenvectors
%	Inputs: reflectance or radiance cube
%	Outputs: gray-scale images
%	Assumptions: no prior target knowledge required
%	Sensitivity to LOI (target knowledge): targets of high-order statistics
%	Sensitivity to Noise: low
%	Operating Bands: VNIR through LWIR
%	Maturity: mature/operational
%	Effectiveness: high
%	Implementation: simple, easy to use, but not real time
%	Brief description:
%		PCA (Gonzalez and Woods, 2002) is probably the most widely used component analysis transform
%		that allows users to data in terms of eigenvalues/eigenvectors via eigen-decomposition
%		where data are preserved and retained according to data variances in the descending order.
